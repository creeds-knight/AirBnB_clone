#AIRBNB_CLONE :sparkles
The AirBnB clone is an attempt at recreating the airbnb website

##AIRBNB_CONSOLE :rocket
The AirBnB console is the first step towards building my first full stack web application.
This step is important because I use this clone to manipulate a powerful storage system.
This storage engine will give an abstraction between "My Object" and How they are stored and persisted. This means from my console code(the command Interpreter built using python CMD module) and from the front-end and RESTAPI.
